<p>Everyone says graduate students tend to overwork, but it is hard to realize it when you are physically there. <br />
There are so much to learn in every single research project and a day by the desk easily flies by. <br />
For me, I only figured out after my first year in graduate school that working longer doesn't necessarily mean working better. 
Since then, I have explored different life routines to try to keep a fresh brain throughout the day. </p>
<p>So far, the one worked best for me is to get up early (around 6:30 am), take a yoga class or do some running, then take a shower and a light breakfast before going to work. I will be by my desk around 9 and I do feel my brain is there with me for most of the day.</p>
<p>When I get a vacation, I love to take a short getaway trip, visit friends, or explore something fun. Here are some of my favorite memories:</p>
