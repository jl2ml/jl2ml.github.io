== About me

I am a fifth year Ph.D. student in Statistics at UCLA. I work on *statistical machine learning* and algebraic statistics with my wonderful advisor Professor [https://www.math.ucla.edu/~montufar/ Guido Montúfar]. 

Prior to graduate school, I did a bachelor in Mathematics with 2 years at [https://www.hku.hk/ the University of Hong Kong] and  2 years at [http://www.math.stonybrook.edu/ SUNY Stony Brook]. I was fortunate to be advised by Professor [http://www.math.stonybrook.edu/~roblaz/ Robert Lazarsfeld] who introduced me to the miraculous world of classical algebraic geometry. 

My first name is pronounced as jyä′ē′.

 Here are topics I am now working on and/or hope to explore in the recent future:
- Feature collapse in terminal phase of training
- Polynomial neural network: optimization and generalization
- Implicit bias and benign overfitting
