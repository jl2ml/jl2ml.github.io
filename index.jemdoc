Hello friend!  
I recently moved from Southern California to Eastern Germany, where I am privileged to work with [https://www.mpi-cbg.de/research/researchgroups/currentgroups/heather-harrington/research wonderful colleagues] at the Max Planck Institute. Together, we explore questions at the interface of mathematics and the life sciences.

My research focuses on the interplay between theoretical machine learning and numerical algebraic geometry ([https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747717116300529 what is ..?]). Specifically, I develop numerical algebro-geometric methods to analyze and characterize the optimization landscapes of neural networks, and I build machine-assisted tools to discover equations and reveal hidden structures—contributing to a deeper theoretical understanding of algebraic geometry.

I spent my PhD years at the (sweet!) [https://statistics.ucla.edu/ Department of Statistics and Data Science] at UCLA, exploring mathematical machine learning, statistics, and data science. Earlier, I completed four years of undergraduate study in mathematics split between the University of Hong Kong and SUNY Stony Brook, where I first fell in love with algebraic geometry and other fascinating areas of modern mathematics.
