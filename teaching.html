<h2>Teaching Statement</h2>
  <div class="infoblock">
  <div class="blockcontent">
<p>Teaching is an important component of my graduate life. I enjoy communicating with my students, sharing knowledge, helping them with questions or walking them through sections that they struggle with. From my own experience, learning statistics, or STEM in general, is an interesting but challenging task which requires practice and patience. <br />
In my labs and office hours, in-person or virtual, I always encourage interation. Sometimes when you are really confused, it might be hard to articulate questions. In each of my lab<em></em><em></em>/discussion sessions, I try to make sure that students feel comfortable asking questions or adding comments, including the ones that are not well formulated or blurry. </p>
  </div></div>
  <div class="infoblock">
  <div class="blockcontent">
<p>Teaching has been an important component of my life throughout graduate school. I have served as a teaching assistant or instructor to courses from undergraduate-level to graduate-level, ranging from accelerated proof-based classes for math or stats majors, general data science courses for non-STEM majors, to management decision courses for business and engineering graduates. </p>

<h2>Reviews from instruction program reports</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>I appreciate the responsiveness and willingness to help students over email. Thank you very much!</p>
</li>
<li><p>Jiayi was an amazing TA, she would always be available for office hours and would help answer any
questions students may have. Very knowledgeable</p>
</li>
<li><p>Jiayi was an excellent TA who cared about students. Her response was fast and precise. She was one
of the best TAs I have ever had.</p>
</li>
<li><p>TA is super nice, very knowledgeable and very helpful in homework and big case projects.</p>
</li>
<li><p>She was a great TA that responded quick to emails and questions with thorough responses.</p>
</li>
<li><p>"Jiayi was a great TA that made sure that her students had time to go over the homework and the coding that was required of them. She also took time out of her time to stay after class to help us figure out our errors and other questions when there was not enough time in class, which was appreciated. </p>
</li>
<li><p>&ldquo;I enjoyed this Ta, she was really knowledgeable and nice!&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li><p>&ldquo;Jiayi was an overall great TA. She was very patient and thorough with her explanations. She was also very good at breaking down the labs, which made them less daunting.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li><p>&ldquo;She explained the concepts very well and made the labs very easy to understand. She was also very approachable and patient, I felt comfortable asking her for help/ additional explanation. She also integrated office hours when students asked which were very helpful for trouble shooting labs and double checking difficult homework problems. Overall great TA.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li><p>&ldquo;TA Li was hands down one of the best TAs I've ever had. I was nervous about the class at the beginning because of the coding labs, but she was really helpful and the coding turned out to be somewhat easier than I expected. She was really helpful in explaining any homework problems and it was clear that she knew exactly how to answer any confusion or mistakes in both labs and homework assignments.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li><p>&ldquo;This TA was very helpful with both labs and homework during our discussion sections.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li><p>&ldquo;Jiayi was an amazing TA, as she was very thorough in clarifying questions of students. She allowed students to share their screens on Zoom when they ran into an error and walked them through the process of fixing it, which was helpful because it taught us how to debug our own code&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li><p>"Jiayi was very knowledgeable of the course material and always willing to help when I was confused. Iâ€™m addition, she was easy to approach and I commend for instructing a zoom class with so little engagement from students cause their cameras were off. </p>
</li>
<li><p>&ldquo;This TA is very kind and concerned with student learning. She moved slow enough so that everyone could follow along.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li><p>&ldquo;This teaching assistant was amazing as they always explained lecture and lab material in a very clear manner that was easy to understand and the teaching assistant was always eager to help the students. This teaching assistant really had no real weaknesses in this course.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
